excerpt: 'This paper aims at assessing CoCos in a stock-flow consistent agent-based model. The JMAB macroeconomic agent-based model by Caiani et al. (2016) is extended by adding: 1. a new class of financial assets, 2. learning behaviours on the part of investors, 3. a variable opinion component (alternating between optimism and prudence on the part of issuing banks and investors) allowing to take into account possible financial contagion effects through information spillovers.'

This paper aims at assessing the effects of CoCo activations in a stock-flow consistent agent-based model. The JMAB macroeconomic agent-based model by Caiani et al. (2016) is extended by adding: 1. a new class of financial assets, 2. learning behaviours on the part of investors, 3. a variable opinion component (alternating between optimism and prudence on the part of issuing banks and investors) allowing to take into account possible financial contagion effects through information spillovers.\

Monte Carlo simulations show that bail-ins resulting from the activation of CoCos in a crisis partially replace costly bailouts for the taxpayer, effectively prevent bank failures and contribute to higher average capital adequacy ratios. This stabilization is positive for the economy as long as the volume of CoCos in circulation is not too high. Below a certain volume, activations are associated with positive second-order effects on investment and GDP. Since there are less bank bankruptcies, banks can keep up with their activities, including lending to firms to finance their investment and production. Above a certain volume, activations negatively affect macroeconomic aggregates. The more CoCos in circulation, the greater the net wealth transfer when bail-ins occur. The negative effects on consumption eventually affects GDP as well.\

CoCos are also likely to play a destabilising role for the financial sphere. When they activate or when banks decide to delay repayment of principal because they are cautious about their solvency, investors may react to such events by turning away from the market. This creates a feedback loop: it becomes harder for banks to set aside Additional Tier 1 capital, which leads to CoCo activations due to a specific contagion channel that seems to be weakening as buyers adapt their behaviour. Two recommendations for prudential regulation follow: (1) The Basel framework should consider more carefully the role of CoCos in the Tier 1 capital compartment. While the CoCo cushion can, all other things being equal, absorb some shocks and limit the use of bailouts, it can also create opportunities for the difficulties of individual banks to spread to the rest of the sector. (2) Every effort should be made to ensure that the way in which CoCos operate is as clear as possible to investors who buy them. This may mitigate over-adjustments in the market in case of disruptions.
