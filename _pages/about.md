I am a postdoctoral researcher at the European Institute on Economics and the Environment (EIEE) in Milan, Italy. I model climate policies and climate risks, using agent-based and DSGE models and combining them with data analysis.

I did my Bachelor and Master studies in Econometrics at Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne University (Paris, France) and completed my PhD at Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne University (Paris, France) and Bielefeld University (Bielefeld, Germany) as part of a joint European Doctorate in Economics Erasmus Mundus (EDEEM).
