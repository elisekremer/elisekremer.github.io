I am a junior economist researcher at the Center for Climate Change (CCC) at Banque de France (Paris, France). I work on incorporating ecosystem services and nature-related risks into macroeconomic financial models.

Prior to this, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the European Institute on Economics and the Environment (EIEE) (Milan, Italy). My work there involved modelling climate policies and climate risks, as well as financial instability, using agent-based models and data analysis.

I did my Bachelor and Master studies in Econometrics at Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne University (Paris, France) and completed my PhD ("Financial Innovations and Macroeconomic Stability: an Assessment of Contingent Convertible Bonds") at Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne University (Paris, France) and Bielefeld University (Bielefeld, Germany) as part of a joint European Doctorate in Economics Erasmus Mundus (EDEEM).
