I am a research economist at the Centre for Climate and Nature (CCN) at Banque de France (Paris, France), where I focus on integrating nature-related risks into macroeconomic and financial models. My work involves developing scenario-based approaches that capture the impacts of ecosystem services and nature degradation on the economy and the financial sector, with the aim of informing supervision and monetary policy. I collaborate with research institutes and other central bankers to promote capacity building on nature modelling.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the European Institute on Economics and the Environment (EIEE) (Milan, Italy), where I designed and applied integrated assessment models to study the macro-financial implications of energy crises and climate policies.

I did my Bachelor and Master studies in Econometrics at Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne University (Paris, France) and completed my PhD ("Financial Innovations and Macroeconomic Stability: an Assessment of Contingent Convertible Bonds") at Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne University (Paris, France) and Bielefeld University (Bielefeld, Germany) as part of a joint European Doctorate in Economics Erasmus Mundus (EDEEM).
