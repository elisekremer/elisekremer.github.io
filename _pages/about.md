I am a postdoctoral researcher at the European Institute on Economics and the Environment (EIEE) in Milan, Italy. I model climate policies and climate risks, as well as financial instability, using agent-based models and combining them with data analysis.

I did my Bachelor and Master studies in Econometrics at Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne University (Paris, France) and completed my PhD ("Financial Innovations and Macroeconomic Stability: an Assessment of Contingent Convertible Bonds") at Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne University (Paris, France) and Bielefeld University (Bielefeld, Germany) as part of a joint European Doctorate in Economics Erasmus Mundus (EDEEM).
